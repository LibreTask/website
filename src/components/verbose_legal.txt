            LibreTask is a task management service. This policy describes the types of personal information we may collect and how we use it to provide the LibreTask service.
          </p>
          <p>
            By using LibreTask, you agree to the collection and use of your personal information as described in this policy. You should know:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              We collect limited account information and store and maintain your account and tasks on our secure servers.
            </li>
            <li>
              We will never rent, sell or share information that personally identifies you for marketing purposes without your express permission.
            </li>
            <li>
              To comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, at this time LibreTask is only available to users who are at least 13 years old. If you are under 13, please do not use the LibreTask service.

          <h3>
            What information do we collect and how do we use it?
          </h3>
          <p>
            When you register with LibreTask, we will request some personal information, including your email and password. Your password will be maintained on our system in a hashed form.
          </p>
          <p>
            The contents of your LibreTask account are stored and maintained on LibreTask servers in order to provide the service. Because we keep back-up copies of data for the purposes of recovery from errors or system failure, residual copies of task content may remain on our systems for some time, even after you have deleted information or after the termination of your account. LibreTask employees do not access the content of any task lists unless you specifically request them to do so (for example, if you are having technical difficulties accessing your account) or if required by law, to maintain our system, or to protect LibreTask or the public.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also may collect information about the use of your account, such as how much storage you are using, how often you log in and other information related to your registration and use of LibreTask. Information displayed or clicked on in your LibreTask account (including UI elements, links, and other information) is also recorded. We use this information internally to deliver the best possible service to you, such as improving the LibreTask user interface.
          </p>
          <h3>
            How we may contact you.
          </h3>
          <p>
            LibreTask may send you information related to your LibreTask account or LibreTask services. Because we believe such information is important, you will not be given the opportunity to opt-out of receiving them.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Transfer of information.
          </h3>
          <p>
            Personal information collected by LibreTask may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which LibreTask maintains facilities. By using LibreTask, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.
          </p>
          <p>
            We reserve the right to transfer your personal information in the event of a transfer of ownership of LibreTask, such as acquisition by or merger with another company. In such an event, LibreTask will notify you before information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Updating your information.
          </h3>
          <p>
            You can terminate your account at any time, by going to the Delete Account page. We typically deactivate accounts within two business days of such requests. You should be aware, however, that residual copies of information may remain stored on our systems even after the deletion of information or the termination of your account.
